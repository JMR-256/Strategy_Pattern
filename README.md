# Strategy_Pattern

This is an educational toy project to practice the strategt pattern.
Different Duck child classes use different implementations of 'behaviours' (QuackBehaviour, FlyBehaviour)
The behaviour interfaces are implemented by various different concrete behaviours ie. different strategies.
